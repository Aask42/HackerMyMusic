## How do I sign up and or submit my instrument?

Should we be selected as a Contest at DEF CON 33, a form will be put up along with instructions on how to submit your recordings ahead of time if you wish to be considered at con but don't have time to sit around designing things and waiting for them to print. 


### PS
* Some other names thrown around have been Printstrument, or Maker My Music, but we decided to go with Hacker My Music because DEF CON is a Hacker Con after all.
